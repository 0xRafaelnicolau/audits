# Detailed Findings

# [H-01] Malicious lender can force users to take on a loan with a higher interest rate than they intended

## Severity
High

## Summary
A malicious lender can force the borrower to accept an interest rate he doesn't agree with by frontrunning the transaction.

## Vulnerability Details
In the following scenario, a malicious lender can force the borrower into accepting a loan with a higher interest rate than anticipated by frontrunning the transaction.

1. The malicious lender creates a pool with a very attractive interest rate (e.g., setting a 0% interest rate) using the `setPool` function.

2. Suppose Bob, an honest user, observes the pool offering a remarkably low interest rate and proceeds to submit a borrowing transaction by calling the `borrow` function.

3. Once the malicious lender detects Bob's transaction in the mempool, he immediately calls `updateInterestRate` (e.g., setting a 1000% interest rate) with a higher gas amount than Bob's transaction to guarantee that his transaction is executed first.

Bob will end up with being frontrunned by the lender, and will take on a loan featuring an exorbitant 1000% interest rate, significantly higher than what he initially intended or agreed upon.

## Impact
As a result of this vulnerability, users may unknowingly accept loans with significantly higher interest rates than they initially agreed upon, leading to potential financial losses and undermining user trust in the lending platform.

## Tools Used
Manual Review.

## Recommendations
Modify the `Borrow` struct in `Structs.sol` by adding an `interestRate` parameter. This change will require borrowers to explicitly specify the interest rate they agree to when initiating a borrowing transaction.

https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/utils/Structs.sol#L25-L32
```solidity
  struct Borrow {
      /// @notice the pool ID to borrow from
      bytes32 poolId;
      /// @notice the amount to borrow
      uint256 debt;
      /// @notice the amount of collateral to put up
      uint256 collateral;
+     /// @notice the interest rate per year the user is agreeing to
+     uint256 interestRate;
  }
```

In the `borrow` function of the `Lender.sol` contract, include a validation step to ensure that the interest rate specified by the borrower matches the interest rate set in the pool. This prevents lenders from imposing arbitrary interest rates on borrowers

https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L234-L244
```solidity
  function borrow(Borrow[] calldata borrows) public {
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < borrows.length; i++) {
          bytes32 poolId = borrows[i].poolId;
          uint256 debt = borrows[i].debt;
          uint256 collateral = borrows[i].collateral;
+         uint256 interestRate = borrows[i].interestRate;           

          ...

          // validate the loan
          if (debt < pool.minLoanSize) revert LoanTooSmall();
          if (debt > pool.poolBalance) revert LoanTooLarge();
          if (collateral == 0) revert ZeroCollateral();
+         if (interestRate != pool.interestRate) revert PoolConfig();

          ...
      }
  }
```

# [M-01] Insufficient support for fee-on-transfer tokens
## Severity
Medium

## Summary
The Lender.sol contract does not support fee-on-transfer tokens. If either loanToken or collateralToken has a fee-on-transfer mechanism, the actual amount of tokens sent or received by users and the protocol could be less than the amount specified in the transfer.

## Relevant GitHub Links
https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-07-beedle/blob/main/src/Lender.sol

## Vulnerability Details
The `addToPool` function in `Lender.sol` receives tokens from the user with amount as an input. If the `loanToken` has a fee-on-transfer mechanism then the actual amount received by `Lender.sol` will be less than the amount passed as an input. The `addToPool` function will then call `_updatePoolBalance` function which will update the `pools` mapping with an inflated amount, leading to all sorts of accounting problems. 

This behavior is present across the whole `Lender.sol` contract.

## Impact
The protocol and users could suffer a loss of funds.

## Tools Used
Manual Review, Solodit

## Recommendations
Consider checking the balance of the contract before and after token transfers and using them instead of the amount specified as an input.

# [I-01] Functions may fail due to exceeded gas limit
## Severity
Informational

## Summary
Multiple functions may fail due to iteration over an unbounded loop.

## Vulnerability Details
The `borrow`, `repay`, `giveLoan`, `startAuction`, `seizeLoan` and `refinance` functions all iterate over an unbounded loop, with arbitrary size, received an input. Since these functions perform multiple external calls each iteration, the block gas limit may be exceeded if the amount of iterations is big enough to cause the transaction to fail.

## Impact
Users stand to lose a substantial amount of gas fees provided with their transaction, which ultimately will fail. This situation can lead to financial losses, and a diminished level of trust in the protocol's reliability.

## Tools Used
Manual Review, Solodit.

## Recommendations
Limit the number of loop iterations to the max number of operations a user can do in bulk on a single transaction.
